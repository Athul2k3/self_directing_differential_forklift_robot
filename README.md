# self_directing_differential_forklift_robot
My first robotic project

This mini project was developed using an Arduino Mega, featuring a forklift operation controlled by a linear actuator. The design incorporates various sensors to enable obstacle detection and manage the locomotion of the robot. The linear actuator ensures precise and efficient lifting and lowering of the forklift mechanism, while the sensors provide real-time feedback for navigating around obstacles, ensuring smooth and safe operation in dynamic environments.
